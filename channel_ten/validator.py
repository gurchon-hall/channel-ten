"""Pure validation logic for VTES TWD YAML files.

Each function here operates on plain dicts (as loaded from YAML) and returns
structured results — no I/O, no CLI concerns.

Error types
-----------
Mandatory tournament fields
  illegal_header     : any of name, location, date_start, rounds_format,
                       players_count, or event_url is absent or blank
                       (forum_post_url is optional — hand-crafted files may omit it)
  unconfirmed_winner : winner is absent/blank, or vekn_number is absent/None
  limited_format     : tournament name contains "Limited" (draft/limited event)

Mandatory deck fields
  illegal_crypt  : deck.crypt is empty, crypt groupings are not a pair of
                   consecutive integers, or deck.crypt_count != sum of card counts
                   (cards with grouping==ANY are ignored in the grouping check)
  illegal_library: deck.library_sections is empty, a section count != sum of
                   its card counts, or deck.library_count != sum of section counts

Player count
  too_few_players : players_count is present but below MIN_PLAYERS (default 12, env-configurable)

Date coherence (requires a calendar_date from the VEKN event calendar)
  incoherent_date : date_start in the file does not match the official date

When multiple errors are present the first one (in the order listed above)
determines the error directory used by the CLI validate command.

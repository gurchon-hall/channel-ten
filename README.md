# Channel 10

Scrape tournament winning decks (TWD) from the [VEKN forum](https://www.vekn.net/forum/event-reports-and-twd) and export them as YAML files.

## Data format

Each tournament produces one YAML file named `{event_id}.yaml` where `event_id` is the numeric id from the VEKN event calendar URL (e.g. `/event/8470` → `8470.yaml`).

Data files are stored in the dedicated repository [gurchon-hall/eternal-vigilance](https://github.com/gurchon-hall/eternal-vigilance), organized as `YYYY/MM/<event_id>.yaml`.

This convention mirrors the [GiottoVerducci/TWD](https://github.com/GiottoVerducci/TWD) archive, which uses `decks/{event_id}.txt`.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gurchon-hall/channel-ten.git
cd channel-ten
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Unix / macOS
& .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # Windows PowerShell
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install              # register git hooks (ruff, pytest, CLI smoke tests)
```

Requires Python ≥ 3.14.

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
# Scrape all pages (starting from page 0)
channel-ten scrape

# Scrape pages 0–4 only (--last-page is inclusive, 0-indexed)
channel-ten scrape --last-page 4

# Start scraping from page 5 and stop at page 6
channel-ten scrape --start-page 5 --last-page 6

# Overwrite existing YAML files
channel-ten scrape --overwrite

# Write output to a custom directory (e.g. a local clone of eternal-vigilance)
channel-ten scrape --output-dir ../eternal-vigilance

# Parse a single local .txt file to YAML (prints to stdout)
channel-ten parse decks/8470.txt

# Parse a .txt file and write YAML to a directory
channel-ten parse decks/8470.txt --output-dir twds

# Convert a YAML file back to .txt (prints to stdout)
channel-ten parse twds/2023/03/9999.yaml

# Re-validate the 25 most recent published YAML files (fast, default)
channel-ten validate

# Re-validate every YAML file in twds/ (slow, rescrapes the forum)
channel-ten validate --full-validation

# Report only — do not move or update any files
channel-ten validate --dry-run

# Publish new decks as a single PR to GiottoVerducci/TWD
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx channel-ten publish

# Publish including pre-2020 decks (skipped by default)
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx channel-ten publish --include-pre-2020

# Simulate publish without opening a PR (branch is deleted afterwards)
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx channel-ten publish --dry-run
```

### Python API

```python
import httpx
from channel_ten.scraper import scrape_forum
from channel_ten.output import write_tournament_yaml
from pathlib import Path

with httpx.Client() as client:
    for tournament, icon in scrape_forum(client, max_pages=2, start_page=5):
        write_tournament_yaml(tournament, output_dir=Path("twds"))
```

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Lint + format
ruff check channel_ten/ tests/
ruff format channel_ten/ tests/

# Run all pre-commit hooks manually against every file
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Pre-commit hooks

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` runs the following checks on every commit:

| Hook | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ruff lint` | Lint with auto-fix (`ruff check --fix`) |
| `ruff format` | Format with ruff |
| `pytest` | Full test suite |
| `cli smoke: scrape --help` | Verify the `scrape` subcommand loads cleanly |
| `cli smoke: parse --help` | Verify the `parse` subcommand loads cleanly |
| `cli smoke: publish --help` | Verify the `publish` subcommand loads cleanly |

The GitHub Actions workflow `pre-commit.yml` runs the same hooks on every push and pull request as a safety net in case local hooks are not installed.

## GitHub Actions

The workflow in `.github/workflows/scrape.yml`:

- Runs daily at 06:00 UTC
- Also triggered on push to `main` when source files change
- Can be triggered manually with optional `start_page`, `last_page`, and `overwrite` inputs
- Scrapes the forum and commits new YAML files to [eternal-vigilance](https://github.com/gurchon-hall/eternal-vigilance)

The workflow in `.github/workflows/validate.yml`:

- Runs every Sunday at 20:00 UTC
- Can be triggered manually with an optional `full_validation` boolean input
- Re-validates all published YAML files in eternal-vigilance, enriches them via krcg, and commits any updates

The workflow in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:

- Runs every Monday at 08:00 UTC
- Can be triggered manually
- Reads decks from eternal-vigilance, publishes new decks to [GiottoVerducci/TWD](https://github.com/GiottoVerducci/TWD) as a single PR
- Commits a Markdown publish report to `eternal-vigilance/publish/YYYY/MM/`

The workflow in `.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml`:

- Runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests
- Installs the `[dev]` dependencies and runs `pre-commit run --all-files`

## Notes

- The scraper respects a 1.5s delay between requests by default (`--delay`).
- Use `--start-page` / `--last-page` to target a specific page range. Both are 0-indexed; `--last-page` is inclusive (page 0 = `limitstart=0`, page 1 = `limitstart=20`, etc.).
- Winner lookup against the VEKN member database is applied automatically during scraping. `vekn_number` is written to the file. Unresolvable names are flagged but not blocked.
- Content validation routes tournaments with errors to `twds/errors/<error_type>/` automatically.
- Forum posts marked with the "merged" icon are written to `twds/changes_required/` instead of the normal date tree, so they can be reviewed before merging.
- `validate` (fast mode) re-validates only the 25 most recent files that are neither stored in errors nor changes required; `--full-validation` rescrapes every published file.
- `publish --dry-run` commits all files to a temporary branch to verify behaviour, then deletes the branch without opening a PR. A dry-run report is saved to `publish/YYYY/MM/dry-run-{date}-{HH-MM-SS}.md`.
- The `User-Agent` header identifies the bot to the server.
- Always verify `robots.txt` and VEKN forum terms before large-scale scraping.
